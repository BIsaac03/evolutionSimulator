<h1> Overview </h1>
Create an environment and watch a handful of organisms adapt to increase their survivability. Each creature must eat food to survive, so well-fed creatures will have more time to
produce offspring. These offspring are nearly identical to their parent, but rare mutations may increase this variance. A new generation of creatures will face the same challenges
as their parents and, with any luck, prove more adept at surviving in their environment. Those who don't will perish.
